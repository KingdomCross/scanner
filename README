The scanner is complete according to the specifications outlined on the project sheet. Three samples have been provided, along with screenshots of the GUI. Some highlights:

1. Complete GUI input and output with file selection
2. Added multi-line commenting for /*-based comments
3. Nice NFA/DFA printout with good documentation
4. Class structure is made to allow further development
5. Error handling (try/catch) for bad input

Thanks to Professor Anthony Giacalone for the original projects for the assignment of CECS 444
